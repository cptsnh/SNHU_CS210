# CS210 Portfolio

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This Portfolio contains three projects from CS210. For the purpose of this assignment I will focus answering questions based on the ChadaClock project.

The purpose of the ChadaClock app was to create an application that enabled Chada Corp. to view and manipulate two clocks simultaneously. One clock is presented in standard 12-hour time, and the other clock is presented in 24-hour military time. The customer can manipulate the time in the following ways: press 1 to increment hours, press 2 to increment minutes, press 3 to increment seconds, and press 4 to exit the application.

## What did you do particularly well?

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
